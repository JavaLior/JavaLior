Hello, everything that will be post here is a school project that is made in Java.

As I have a little knowledge in Java i think keeping the project in here would make things a little bit easier for me.

In case you would like to assist me in my project I'm available either on discord(JuggerTac#2022) or twitter (@JuggerTac)

Thank you anyway!

See you soon with an update on my project. (Maybe you can learn a little as well xD)
